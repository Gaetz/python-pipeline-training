# Virtual environments

A virtual environment is used to store in a specific location (usually the project folder) the dependencies we need for a project.

Create a virtual environment with command:
```
python -m venv env
```
`env` is the name of the environment.

Activate the venv on windows:
```
env/Scripts/activate
```

On macOS/linux:
```
source enc/bin/activate
```

If you want to deactivate the venv:
```
deactivate
```

You can now install packages with `pip install`. Check the packages with `pip list`

If you want to store the list of dependencies for this project:
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

If I am on an other computer and I want to create a new venv with the same dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Remove the venv folder if you do not want the virtual environment.
